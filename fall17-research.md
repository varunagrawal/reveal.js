# Fall 2017 Research Plan

---

## Problem Statement

1. Can we have a Visual QA/Dialog system improve its internal representations?
2. Can we improve the results on novel questions?
3. New applications and problem domains for these results
---

## Prior Work

- Graph-Structured Representations for Visual Question Answering
        
        Develops a graph structure over the image content and the questions being asked to prime the answers.
- The VQA-Machine: Learning How to Use Existing Vision Algorithms to Answer New Questions

        Use of existing methods for common tasks to improve the VQA task

- Knowledge Acquisition for Visual Question Answering via Iterative Querying

        Can the answer to a question be a clarifying question in order to return the best results?

## Proposed Work

1. Understand and establish baselines for graph based inference for VQA.
2. Examine the signals provided by Dialog models to see what can be learned from them, conditioned on current knowledge.
3. Techniques for updating knowledge representations based on new signals.
4. Generalization to novel questions.

## Schedule

- Target: **ECCV 2018**
- September-October: Establish baselines.
- November-December: Incorporate Dialog elements
- January-February: Experiments on improving results based on Dialog feedback and novel question answering.
